- Create a webhook based application (git as source)
Test website availability
-------------------------
while true; do curl -Is http://code.clouapps.3.8.96.43.nip.io | head -n 1 ;done

- Change git code and commit
- Check for application drops

- Take any project and expose svc to route
  $oc expose svc/s2icode 
  
- Browse the website and view cert details in crome " It shows openshift default CA screen shot attached"

- Delete the route
  oc delete route s2icode 
  
- Create new route and attach certificate 
  $ oc create route edge --service=s2icode --cert=device.crt --key=device.key --ca-cert=rootCA.pem --hostname=secureapp.cloudapps.3.8.96.43.nip.io
  
- Browse back and view certificate details " It change from openshift cert to Master_CA cert"
